## Assignment

>  design and build a wired &/or wireless network connecting at least two processors

Due to lack of time I have been working on my [final project](w20-final.html), which will include a I2C network of 
    modules controlled by a master. 

I will be updating this page with the networking related sections once I'm able to make progress on the final project.
