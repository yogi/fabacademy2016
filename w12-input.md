## Assignment

> measure something: add a sensor to a microcontroller board that you have designed and read it

## Planning

I reviewed [Neil's lecture](https://vimeo.com/162721990) and started making a list of sensors that seemed interesting:
 
* Ambient light sensor: useful for my [final project](w1-principles.html)
* Motion sensor: useful for my final project
* Step response: for its versatility
* Video: because I'm interested in gesture recognition
