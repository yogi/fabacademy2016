This was a 2 week assignment to build a machine in a group. I was in Team-1 along with:

* [Muhammed Jaseel P.](../../students/390/index.html)
* [Nisha Elsa Johnson](../../students/376/index.html)
* [Paul Anand](../../students/465/index.html)
* [Rashid Thattayil](../../students/394/index.html)
* [Sibu Saman](../../students/281/index.html)
* [Vinod Kumar B. G.](../../students/403/index.html)

We built a 2-axis multi-fab machine (plotter + lathe).

## Highlights 

* Started building a lathe, moved to building a 2-axis machine with changeable tool-heads (plotter + lathe-tool-bit in the first iteration)
* Salvaged inkjet printer parts from local scrapyard
* Some parts are 3D printed  
* Custom-built acrylic stages
* RAMPS controller running a g-code interpreter available over serial interface

Our machine-building journey is described in detail here: __[Team 1: 2-Axis Multi-Fab Machine](../../machine_building/team_1/index.html).__
